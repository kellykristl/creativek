PWP Project
This is a personal website portfolio

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work. Your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case are all clearly outlined. Your HTML code is excellent and the project is set up exactly according to specifications. 

This is the TL; DR as I interpret it:
- one page developer portfolio aimed to Sr. Level IT
- emphasis on highlighting front-end development
- eye catching graphics, with a focus on a quality desktop layout at hi-resolution
- relevant information upfront (Perhaps the use of graphics will work well here?) 
- preference for remote development positions doing front-end work and PHP

You've done a nice job outlining the points above in regards to your direction here. These considerations will definitely have an impact on your content and layout design choices to follow. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape!

You are clear to begin on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). Go ahead and read the documentation on bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu if you like. I will be going over [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) in class on Monday 5/1 as well.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Excellent work on your wireframes and content strategy. The clarity that you have here will serve as a great guide for your development going forward. 

The layout choices you've made will be straightforward to implement using the Bootstrap grid system. From what I can see here, your mobile-to-desktop responsive layout can be achieved with a simple implementation of the grid system in a way that is  similar to what I've demonstrated in class. It will also be very similar to the Bootstrap Challenge exercise. 

For your image gallery functionality, I recommend a look at the [fancybox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) jQuery plugin. This has been used by students in the past with nice results, and it is fully responsive and pretty easy to implement.

In the next front-end lecture module, I'll be going over how to wire up the Contact Form. First, you'll need to have the contact form built-out in Bootstrappy HTML (see [Bootstrap Forms](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms)). If you'd like to read ahead on getting the form working, the full documentation is here: [jQuery Validated Contact Form for PWP](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/)

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on your PWP! Build your layout directly inside the `/public_html` directory. You do not need to use the `/documentation` directory any more.

## Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Don't forget the `alt` attribute on your `<img>` tags.
