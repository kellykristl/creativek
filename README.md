## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work. Your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case are all clearly outlined. Your HTML code is excellent and the project is set up exactly according to specifications. 

This is the TL; DR as I interpret it:
- one page developer portfolio aimed to Sr. Level IT
- emphasis on highlighting front-end development
- eye catching graphics, with a focus on a quality desktop layout at hi-resolution
- relevant information upfront (Perhaps the use of graphics will work well here?) 
- preference for remote development positions doing front-end work and PHP

You've done a nice job outlining the points above in regards to your direction here. These considerations will definitely have an impact on your content and layout design choices to follow. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape!

You are clear to begin on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). Go ahead and read the documentation on bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu if you like. I will be going over [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) in class on Monday 5/1 as well.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
