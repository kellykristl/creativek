		<h1 class="header">Persona</h1>
		<p><strong>John Smith - developer and potential employer</strong></p>
		<p>John is mid-to-late 30's and is a developer at the managerial level. He is looking for a well-rounded, full-stack developer to join his team. He is on a desktop iMac with high resolution, large monitor and super fast internet connection. This computer is at his workplace. </p>

		<h1 class="header">Use Case</h1>
		<p>John has limited time to review my personal portfolio, as he has hundreds of applicants for one position. My site needs to be clean, simple and quick with eye -catching graphics and upfront information about me. I only have a couple minutes of his time to convince him that I am the perfect match for the developer position within his company.</p>
